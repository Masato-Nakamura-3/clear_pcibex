# Read Me

This is a tentative Read Me file for an online PCIbex experiment with audio recording.

- **"data_includes" directory** contains the main script

- **"chunk includes" directory** contains the relevant files such as html files for instructions or audio files for examples to present

The stimuli set is replaced with a dummy version since I was not the one who created the one I used in my study.


If you are using the LSC server, see the instructions to it too.



## Key points about the design

- Participants are asked to produce a continuation to each context presented to them.

- The experiment consists of two blocks: Long and Short

- In a Long trial, the context is first presented in a black font and then it turns to red after 1600ms.

- In a Short trial, the context is presented in red from the beginning.

- In both conditions, the context in red is presented for 1200ms.

- Participants are asked to produce continuations while the font is red
- The audio is recorded from the presentation of the context until 2000ms after the context is removed from the display
